**Setup Guide**
1. Download [this](https://github.com/dista64/SM64-Tournament-Stream-Tool/releases/tag/Timer).
2. Extract 'SM64 Tournament Stream Tool.zip'.
3. Open the following folders: 'SM64 Tournament Stream Tool\resources\Stream Tool' and you should see 'Game Scoreboard.html'. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b4500de-fb1d-42d0-8100-9adcd7df11b6)
4. Click and drag 'Game Scoreboard.html' into your sources on OBS. ![2025-01-1116-39-37-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1545bdd3-8e01-4d29-9346-d2d5a5332ab0)
5. Go up 2 folders until you're back in 'SM64 Tournament Stream Tool' and find 'SM64 Tournament Stream Tool.exe', this is the app you will use to update info on stream. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e58eed1-9931-4263-8093-45759735ce29)
6. Customize the information you want on stream in the app, then watch it update on the overlay (note social media @s under the caster's names alternate so you can't see the bluesky @s in this screenshot). Please note, the timer controls function independently from the update button (you still need to hit update to show/hide the timer on the overlay).
